# Travelling Salesman Problem

ThIs is a solution to the TSP using 
1. A\* algorithm with Minimum Spanning Tree as a heuristic.
2. Genetic algorithm (open the files to see parameters)

To run the program in your local system
1. Clone the repository  
 ` git clone git@github.com:adityabandal/Travelling-Salesman-Problem.git`
1. Run following command 
`./run_astar`
to run using A star algorithm and
`./run_genetic`
to run using Genetic algorithm

3. An executable file named will be created.
4. Enter nXn matrix of distance between cities in **input.txt** file and run executable. Examples can be taken from [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html)
